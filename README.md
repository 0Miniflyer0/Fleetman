# FleetMan

### Mission
The mission of FleetMan is to provide an easy way for fleetmanagers to view and log maintenance within a fleet a vehicles. 

### How we are achieving this
We are achieving that by using a database hosted with Firebase connected to an app that is created using React Native.

## What can it do?
Currently our app has functionaity to interact to the database to display all of the vehicles inside of the database as well as all of the maintence records for said vehicles.

Our app gives fleetmanagers the option to add new vehicles and new maintenance records to keep track of the fleet.
